The bot is designed to classify user inputs into predefined categories (intents) and generate responses using a trained neural network. It is highly customizable and can be easily extended with new intents, responses, and features. It is made arround the theme of pirates as well so that it stays entertaining.

Features
Natural Language Processing: Leverages TensorFlow and Keras to tokenize, train, and classify text-based inputs.
Customizable Intents: Use MongoDB to dynamically manage the intents and responses for the chatbot.
REST API Integration: Expose endpoints for retrieving and adding new intents using Flask.
User-Friendly Chat Interface: Provides interactive communication with users via the terminal.
Persistent Data Storage: Stores intents and responses in a MongoDB collection for long-term management and updates.


Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language
Flask: For RESTful API development
TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training the chatbot model
MongoDB: For intent and response storage
Pandas: For data preprocessing
Numpy: For numerical operations
